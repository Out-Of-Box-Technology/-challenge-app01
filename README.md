  - Readability, consistency — how easy it is to read and understand sections of the code; this includes code clarity, simplicity, and documentation.
  - Predictability, reliability, and robustness — software behavior should be predictable, and not prone to hidden bugs.
  - Maintainability and extensibility — fixing, updating and improving software should be as simple as possible, not inherently complex.
- Technologies, libraries and skills
  - Frontend : React-Native, Expo, Flutter, Native Android (Java, Kotlin) or Native iOS (Swift, Objective-C)
  - Map : Google Maps or Apple Maps
